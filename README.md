This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy when modifying a list while iterating over it using `eachWithIndex`.  The code attempts to remove elements that match a specific criteria. Directly modifying the list during iteration with `eachWithIndex` will throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`. The solution shows how to safely remove elements by using an iterator or creating a new list.
